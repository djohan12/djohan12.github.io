                    <p class="details">
                        &nbsp;To Steven Levy, a hacker means a lot more than the stereotypical break into a system hacker. Instead, a hacker is someone who is able to take whatever resources they have and create something innovative and clever. In addition, these “True Hackers” adhere to the “hacker ethic,” which emphasizes decentralized free access to information to create powerful and meaningful tools through the use of computers. Levy provides several examples of people who exhibit these hacker characteristics. For example, Peter Sampson wanted to enhance the experience of playing Spacewar. Previously Spacewar had generated random pixels to represent the stars in the sky; instead, Sampson researched the constellations and generated a starry background based on the information that he could find. Sampson took the pre-existing game and took it to the next level by applying his knowledge he acquired to the game to enhance the gameplay experience. Another example was Stew-art Nelson. Nelson was another student at MIT who was intrigued by the potential of the telephone. He firmly believed in the hacker initiative, believing that innovation could flourish if people pushed boundaries and explored systems more deeply. Nelson’s approach to innovation reflects the hands-on imperative, the idea that hackers must learn from getting their hands dirty with these systems.
                        <br><br>&nbsp;Levy’s version of hacking contrasts with how pop-culture and society portrays hackers. Whenever I think of hacking, my first thoughts go to cybersecurity. Back in high school. I was part of the cybersecurity club, and whenever we discussed the topic of hackers, we’d talk about cyber attacks like remote access, backdoors, and malware. After taking technical ethics a couple years ago, the topic of hacking expanded to the idea of ethical hacking as well, the idea of trying to attack a system to create stronger protection against potential attacks. In both cases, the term hacker was always associated with online security. Pop-culture also reinforced this interpretation of hackers, as we see in movies like The Matrix, Tron, and many others (I don’t watch a lot of movies, so I can only name those two off the top of my head (and I haven’t even watched them)). 
                        <br><br>&nbsp;After reading the passage, I have another interpretation of the word hacker. From its dictionary definition, the word hacking is attributed with tearing or breaking something apart. This is sort of the origin of the pop-culture hacker, as these hackers are breaking into and potentially damaging systems. I think that the core idea of breaking something can still apply to the idea of a “True Hacker.” To me, “True Hackers” are people who are bold and creative enough to break the norms or meta. Hackers take what they have and they create something better and new with that. Think about everyday apps we use like Amazon, Google, or Facebook. When they were being created, the idea of using the internet in those ways was unheard of, but the hacker minds behind them used what they had (resources, knowledge, technology) to create something revolutionary. This spirit of hacking isn’t confined to software alone; this hacker mentality of challenging conventions and questioning what’s possible can be applied to everyday problems. After all, there’s a reason why we call them life hacks. For example, you can use binder clips as makeshift deskside cable holders or wrap banana stems in foil to improve their shelf life. I also have a personal life hack for getting more bang for your buck at Chipotle. If you ever want a burrito, buy a burrito bowl and ask for an extra tortilla on the side. It might be a little bit more expensive, but you end up getting more filling then if you had just ordered a burrito. Sure the burrito example is a bit out of left field, but the same guiding principle is there: applying your knowledge, experiences, and resources in order to discover optimal solutions and patterns.
                        <br><br>&nbsp;So whether it’s coding up the next big software platform or just trying to get more out of your Chipotle bowl, we should strive to live like “True Hackers” and try to create bold and innovative solutions to improve our own and others’ lives.
