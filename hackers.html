                    <p class="details">
                        &nbsp;Startups have been a valid career option for new grads coming out of college because of the prospects of wealth. Paul Graham is partially right about startups. Are they a way to get absolutely loaded? Yup. Most of the richest people in the world got their wealth from their startups. Think Mark Zuckerberg, Jensen Huang, Jeff Bezos: most of the world’s wealthiest people got their wealth from starting businesses that have evolved into tech giants. They had ideas that would revolutionize how we live our lives, and now their companies are worth billions of dollars. However,  I don’t think that they’re a surefire way of getting rich. Startups are a very high-risk high-reward investment. For every Amazon, there are at least a dozen Webvans. Most people who try to make bank from startups do so only because of the major success stories of big tech startups. I’m just saying, there’s a fairly good chance that you’ve never even heard of Webvan, which proves my point. You only ever hear about the big boy startups, not all the failed startups that get swept under the rug. 
                        <br><br>&nbsp;With that in mind, I don’t think that I could found a startup, at least right now. Need I remind you, I have a degree in Computer Science, not starting a business. I know basically nothing about business, or money, or anything needed for a startup. Not to mention, I think the stress would probably eat me alive. Like Graham says: “If you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a million dollars’ worth of pain.” Especially coming fresh out of undergrad, I’m definitely not ready for that kind of pain. It just feels like there are way too many responsibilities and stress points that would make me crack, especially when I have very little experience of being completely independent in the real world. Not to mention all of the gambles I would need to take in order to make a startup succeed. Like I said I have basically no experience making big decisions on my own, especially ones that fine the line between prosperity and bankruptcy. Because at that level, I’m not just making decisions for myself, I’m making decisions that can negatively affect everyone if I make the wrong choice. I’m the kind of person who doubts almost everything I do, and I feel like if I were at the helm of a startup I would spend a lot of nights overthinking every little decision I’ve made, and I think I would actually go insane.
	                    <br><br>&nbsp;That being said, I wouldn’t mind working for/with a startup. I have no problem taking a step back and working from behind the scenes to get work done; I just don’t trust myself with that level of responsibility. I like designing and programming things just because I enjoy that kind of creative freedom. Like for the last hackers project, I put in a lot of time and effort into it because I wanted to create a really cool tool for the Video Game Club. I feel a lot more comfortable when I’m given some kind of idea and I have the freedom to make it however I want. So I guess the main thing holding me back from starting a company isn’t so much the work demands, but rather the increase in responsibility. 
                        <br><br>&nbsp;Additionally, with how drastic the world is changing, startup ideas too are always changing. For a startup to really succeed, there has to be some revolutionary out of the box thinking. When computers were still becoming a thing, I don’t think the average person was thinking about using computers to buy something from the other side of the world, but here we are now. The same thing applies to us in 20+ years, new startups will evolve into who knows what. Realistically, they’ll probably start delving into AI applications with embedded systems, but that’s just a theory; maybe it’ll be something more insane, but again, who’s to tell? Maybe by that time, I’ll have enough industry experience/confidence to start my own company, but at present, I’m basically still a fledgling and putting me in the position of founding a startup is no less than throwing me off a cliff, so I’ll err on the side of caution and just stick to a 9-5 for the next couple years while I get my life sorted out.

                        Reading 05: Coding is Basically a 0x0000ff Collar Job
                    </h1>

                    <p class="details">
                        &nbsp;As computer scientists, you’re expected to know like a bazillion different coding languages to land a job. While some people get overly attached or passionate to certain coding languages, to me, programming languages are just tools, and when you’re building something, you want to use the best tools for the job. For example, you wouldn’t use assembly language for machine learning in the same way you wouldn’t use a hammer to put in a screw (unless you’re insane in which case, no judgement). Each language has its own strengths, so when we specialize in one, we focus on designing solutions that play to its capabilities. For example C is great for low-level systems-based functions, but Python however is more versatile. There are more importable libraries for more uses. So when I do C based programming, I have to think about memory allocation and management to make sure I’m not getting any null pointers or segfaults. On the other hand, memory management is automatic in python and since it’s pass-by-reference,  I don’t have to worry about pointers, meaning I can think less about memory and more on how to implement a certain program.
                        <br><br>&nbsp;The overall strength of a programming language comes down to two main factors. First, like I mentioned earlier, how/what the language is being used for is a major consideration. Javascript and C might be two powerful languages, but they each play to their own strengths and weaknesses. The other main consideration is how efficient and understandable the language is. Obviously meme languages like SPL and Brainf*ck are basically useless. They’re essentially like writing a research paper in hieroglyphics: unintelligible. If I’m writing/reading code, I want the language to be understandable enough that I can take a quick look at it and know what the code is doing. If I have to go online every time to find the Shakespeare quote for int x=0, coding a full program is gonna be an absolute nightmare. 
                        <br><br>&nbsp;Second, if the programming language doesn’t use resources effectively, I also wouldn’t want to use it. If a language doesn’t make good use of memory management, not only will it take ages for code to run, but it won’t be compatible for code bases that depend on timely read/writes or other synchronous programs. That being said, the languages that we consider strong today might not be very applicable in the future. When computers were first invented, the only language they understood was machine code. By today’s standards, I wouldn’t consider machine code to be very powerful: it’s difficult to implement and requires a lot of diagrams/scratch work in order to code a program. However back in the day, it was the strongest coding language because it was the only coding language. Like Graham said in his articles, programming languages are constantly evolving. Quantum computing has shown a lot of promise and is a big step from modern computers, so in a couple years, new programming languages will develop to take advantage of quantum computers’ capabilities, rendering modern languages obsolete.
                        <br><br>&nbsp;At the end of the day, software engineering is a vast and constantly changing field, with a lot of different tools to our disposal. Every programming language has its strengths and weaknesses, and what we consider strong today may become outdated tomorrow. But for now, the “strongest” languages are subjective. You shouldn’t feel pressured to learn or use a certain language unless it’s what you believe is the best tool for the job. Like how a carpenter knows how to use his tools, a software engineer should know how and when to use programming languages to the best of his/her ability.

                        Reading 04: Nerds, Hackers, and Asian Tiger Moms 
                    </h1>

                    <p class="details">
                        &nbsp;For the most part, Paul Graham’s vision of a hacker is fairly similar to Steven Levy’s description of hackers. They are both described with similar attitudes about using computers to create useful artifacts. I personally thought that Graham’s interpretation of hackers is more thorough compared to Levy’s. Levy’s  book felt more like a story about hackers whereas Graham’s readings felt like they got deeper into why we hack and what it means to be a hacker. I felt like I connected more with Graham as he was talking about hackers and computer science as a whole.
                        <br><br>&nbsp;The essay that I found the most interesting was the one on nerds because I resonated with it and there were some really interesting points made. I grew up in a predominantly Asian community, where most of my classmates were, for lack of a better term, “nerds.” Many of us were drawn to niche interests like anime, video games, and studying, rather than the more typical activities associated with American high schoolers. Ironically, our school’s social hierarchy wasn’t based on popularity, but instead how difficult your classes were. The main categories were regular, honors, and AP/IB, but there were other things that would boost your status like whether you skipped a math or science class (I kid you not there was one kid my freshman year who was already taking Calc III at CSUF). This hierarchy was a result of Asian culture in my community. Many of us were children of immigrant parents, so there was this expectation of academic excellence, and as high schoolers, we sought validation by comparing ourselves with others, always striving for the top at the expense of having a normal high school social life.
                        <br><br>&nbsp;The thing that really stood out to me in that reading was the analogy of suburbs to a nursery. I’ve already heard the analogy of school to a prison multiple times, and I agree; you just go to school for 8 hours every day, learn things that may or may not be useful, and then have more school work afterwards. I’ve never heard of comparing a suburb to a nursery, and it made me think a lot more about my childhood. Like I mentioned earlier, I had a fairly strict childhood in Socal where I just studied, participated in clubs, hung out with friends every now and then, or stayed at home. As Graham said, it was basically just a raising ground for children and teens. We’re raised in this environment where everything is set up for us and we only know what we’re expected to know from school. Because of this structured learning environment, there isn’t a whole lot of room for creativity, expression, or curiosity; we’re just expected to not ask any questions and follow suit. We’re limited in our perspective and don’t really have a good understanding about how vast the world really is. The problem is that the real world doesn’t come with outlines for us to fill in. We’re taught how to succeed in these controlled environments, but that doesn’t necessarily translate to the real world. When you’re taught only to color in the lines, you can’t create your own art piece. 
                        <br><br>&nbsp;On the topic of art, I think this is one of the main things that Graham was trying to get to in his essay on hackers and painters. One of the main points about that piece was that hacking is less about science and more about design. Design has always been at the root of computer science. Algorithms have certain designs in order to optimize certain tasks, languages are designed to have certain optimization, heck, the entire OS of a computer is designed a certain way from data management, to processes, to input and output devices. Every part of computer science was carefully thought out and designed like details in a painting. Hacking isn’t just about how well you know a certain language or how many hours you put into leetcode. It’s a matter of creative expression: what kind of innovative solutions are you able to come up with in order to solve a problem? This is the same impression I got from reading Levy’s book on hackers. Hackers shouldn’t just be limited to knowledge of software, but rather the kinds of out-of-the-box thinking you can come up with to create “art” for lack of a better term.
                        <br><br>&nbsp;Overall, I think Graham’s and Levy’s ideas of what it means to be a hacker align closely. Both interpretations reflect the key principles of the hacker ethic. The main difference is that Levy presents hackers as a subculture focused on creating software tools to challenge larger institutions, whereas Graham emphasizes a mindset centered on the creative process of building software tools. Graham’s perspective, in particular, reinforces my own view of being a hacker: approaching software development with a creative and solution-oriented mindset.

                        Reading 03: Hackers Never Die 
                    </h1>

                    <p class="details">
                        &nbsp;	This week's reading covered the final hacking era: the gaming era. The two previous generations, the True and Hardware Hackers, share a lot of similarities with the latest, as they all focus on decentralized access to computers and coming up with creative solutions through computers. Where they differ is their means and purposes of execution. The previous two generations were hackers solely because of their love of computers and information and making them more accessible to the general public. While the game hackers also wanted to share their work with others, love of computers wasn’t the only driving force. The game hackers acted on their desire to use computers as a medium for creativity. During the 80s, we saw an influx of programmers creating games just for the fun of it. Games like “Mystery House” and “Wizard and the Princess” were created because developers wanted to make a fun adventure/puzzle game rather than increase productivity or teach. 
                        <br><br>&nbsp;As always, capitalism found a way to slide into the gaming world. Before there were online stores like Steam or the App Store, programmers would sell floppy disks containing the code for their games, which understandable; you put in lots of hours into a project you’re really passionate about, you wouldn’t just give it out for free. The problem is that once one person starts to make money, everyone starts trying to make money from it. As a result, the games that were developed were no longer driven by hackers’ desire to create exciting projects, but by businesses focused on maximizing profits. They weren't looking for genius hackers anymore, but any connections or market advantages that could make them more money. And unfortunately, a lot of games are like that now where companies are making less exciting games and are just focused on making money. I won’t name any names, but certain companies love to create “new” games by repurposing old games, adding a couple extra features, and selling it as a revolutionary sequel for full price. Not to mention remakes of old games where the only thing changed are enhanced graphics and one or two extra easter eggs. You can see that companies care more about cutting corners or appealing to their audience than creating compelling and engaging games. Nostalgia and hype often take precedence over creativity, and new titles are frequently sold at prices that outweigh their entertainment value.
                        <br><br>&nbsp;Computers and the field of hacking have come a long way since their introduction: from simple mathematical calculations, to making games, to the internet, and now to development of Artificial Intelligence. They were the 20th and 21st century equivalent of the gold rush, where a sign of promise led to companies trying to capitalize on the new opportunities that arose. All modern infrastructure is heavily dependent on them and as a result, technology has become more monopolistic as only a handful of computer companies control the flow of information. To put it simply, there’s no way for the Hacker Ethic to truly and fully survive in the modern world. Technology has become too centralized for the hacker ethic to survive fully. With governments controlling what people can see online and big tech companies capitalizing on users, there’s just no room for the hacker ethic to thrive. Additionally, many people who are in tech jobs nowadays are doing it for the big bucks rather than a passion. While there are those who pursue a job in software because they love computers, the vast majority do it for the paycheck. 
                        <br><br>&nbsp;That being said, the hacker ethic isn’t completely dead. We may have to disregard some parts of the hacker ethic in order to make a living, but we can still practice the hacker ethic online. There are many open-source programmers who try to decentralize access to content or improve existing project repositories. Anyone with a passion or curiosity for these topics pick up a computer and start coding away. Because that’s what it means to be a hacker.

                        Reading 02: Hackers Hackers Everywhere
                    </h1>

                    <p class="details">
                        &nbsp;The True and Hardware Hackers are two sides of the same coin; they are believers in the hacker ethic focusing  on the decentralized access of technology for the good of society rather than political or economic gain. Where they differ is their methods of execution. The True Hackers strive to create and refine software while Hardware Hackers strive to design and share hardware with others. The reading this week explores how Hardware Hackers try to spread awareness and teach others about the uses of new technologies like computers at the time.
                        <br><br>&nbsp;One of the main things I see nowadays that the reading highlights is the idea of an aura of elitism. This is the idea that technology can only be used by those who are specially trained, but the fact is that anyone can learn how to use a computer. All the information is out there on the internet, all you have to do is look for it and learn. Bob Albrecht taught a class at the Control Data Corporation in which he taught students how to use a computer. This class eventually became a bazaar (get it?) of knowledge, with students sharing knowledge and teaching each other. A couple of years later, Albrecht would open his own nonprofit, the Portola Institute, focused on educating kids about the world of computers. Albrecht’s drive perfectly encapsulates what the Hacker Ethic strives for. He showed that learning about computers isn’t restricted to an age range or background. Anyone is able to learn how to use technology, it just comes down to whether you are willing to take the first steps. 
                        <br><br>&nbsp;Now, one of the main concerns that arose as technology became more commercialized is that the spirit of the hacker ethic was being replaced with pure utility. As computers became more prevalent, computers were viewed less of an art and merely as a tool to accomplish commonplace tasks. While I do believe that the hacker ethic is a good thing to live by, I don’t think that the commercialization of technology is necessarily a bad thing. I’m not expecting everyone in the world to become a hacker (for one it would be kind of boring if everyone was just hooked onto their screens). Hackers are hackers because they are passionate about working with computers. If you force everyone to live by the hacker ethic, you’re essentially taking away the passion that makes hackers hackers. Computers were initially made to help with advanced calculations and nowadays it’s a necessary utility for everyday life. While people shouldn’t have to be hackers, they should still have at least fundamental knowledge of the powerful applications of computers.
                        <br><br>&nbsp;Of course, with the rapid growth of technology, there are warranted questions about the morality of technology.  I side more with Lee Felsenstein’s argument that technology is a force for good. While I agree that technology can absolutely be used to oppress people, I don’t think that we should label technology as inherently bad. Over the years, we’ve seen how people in power have used technology to change society at other people’s expenses. Governments have used technology to spy on citizens, build destructive weapons, and divide people with propaganda and misinformation. Despite those oppressive uses of technology, I don’t think those outweigh the good technology has had in our lives. Many of the systems that we rely on are built on technology. Without technology, we wouldn’t be able to stay connected with family, make breakthroughs in medicine to save lives, or have access to free information online. I think that the power of the Hacker Ethic lies in the Hands-on Imperative. Knowledge is power; having access to knowledge and knowing what computers are capable of is essential in the modern age to properly benefit society.

                        Reading 01: Hacker? I Barely Know Her!
                    </h1>

                    <p class="details">
                        &nbsp;To Steven Levy, a hacker means a lot more than the stereotypical break into a system hacker. Instead, a hacker is someone who is able to take whatever resources they have and create something innovative and clever. In addition, these “True Hackers” adhere to the “hacker ethic,” which emphasizes decentralized free access to information to create powerful and meaningful tools through the use of computers. Levy provides several examples of people who exhibit these hacker characteristics. For example, Peter Sampson wanted to enhance the experience of playing Spacewar. Previously Spacewar had generated random pixels to represent the stars in the sky; instead, Sampson researched the constellations and generated a starry background based on the information that he could find. Sampson took the pre-existing game and took it to the next level by applying his knowledge he acquired to the game to enhance the gameplay experience. Another example was Stew-art Nelson. Nelson was another student at MIT who was intrigued by the potential of the telephone. He firmly believed in the hacker initiative, believing that innovation could flourish if people pushed boundaries and explored systems more deeply. Nelson’s approach to innovation reflects the hands-on imperative, the idea that hackers must learn from getting their hands dirty with these systems.
                        <br><br>&nbsp;Levy’s version of hacking contrasts with how pop-culture and society portrays hackers. Whenever I think of hacking, my first thoughts go to cybersecurity. Back in high school. I was part of the cybersecurity club, and whenever we discussed the topic of hackers, we’d talk about cyber attacks like remote access, backdoors, and malware. After taking technical ethics a couple years ago, the topic of hacking expanded to the idea of ethical hacking as well, the idea of trying to attack a system to create stronger protection against potential attacks. In both cases, the term hacker was always associated with online security. Pop-culture also reinforced this interpretation of hackers, as we see in movies like The Matrix, Tron, and many others (I don’t watch a lot of movies, so I can only name those two off the top of my head (and I haven’t even watched them)). 
                        <br><br>&nbsp;After reading the passage, I have another interpretation of the word hacker. From its dictionary definition, the word hacking is attributed with tearing or breaking something apart. This is sort of the origin of the pop-culture hacker, as these hackers are breaking into and potentially damaging systems. I think that the core idea of breaking something can still apply to the idea of a “True Hacker.” To me, “True Hackers” are people who are bold and creative enough to break the norms or meta. Hackers take what they have and they create something better and new with that. Think about everyday apps we use like Amazon, Google, or Facebook. When they were being created, the idea of using the internet in those ways was unheard of, but the hacker minds behind them used what they had (resources, knowledge, technology) to create something revolutionary. This spirit of hacking isn’t confined to software alone; this hacker mentality of challenging conventions and questioning what’s possible can be applied to everyday problems. After all, there’s a reason why we call them life hacks. For example, you can use binder clips as makeshift deskside cable holders or wrap banana stems in foil to improve their shelf life. I also have a personal life hack for getting more bang for your buck at Chipotle. If you ever want a burrito, buy a burrito bowl and ask for an extra tortilla on the side. It might be a little bit more expensive, but you end up getting more filling then if you had just ordered a burrito. Sure the burrito example is a bit out of left field, but the same guiding principle is there: applying your knowledge, experiences, and resources in order to discover optimal solutions and patterns.
                        <br><br>&nbsp;So whether it’s coding up the next big software platform or just trying to get more out of your Chipotle bowl, we should strive to live like “True Hackers” and try to create bold and innovative solutions to improve our own and others’ lives.
