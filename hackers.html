                        Reading 03: Hackers Never Die 
                    </h1>

                    <p class="details">
                        &nbsp;	This week's reading covered the final hacking era: the gaming era. The two previous generations, the True and Hardware Hackers, share a lot of similarities with the latest, as they all focus on decentralized access to computers and coming up with creative solutions through computers. Where they differ is their means and purposes of execution. The previous two generations were hackers solely because of their love of computers and information and making them more accessible to the general public. While the game hackers also wanted to share their work with others, love of computers wasn’t the only driving force. The game hackers acted on their desire to use computers as a medium for creativity. During the 80s, we saw an influx of programmers creating games just for the fun of it. Games like “Mystery House” and “Wizard and the Princess” were created because developers wanted to make a fun adventure/puzzle game rather than increase productivity or teach. 
                        <br><br>&nbsp;As always, capitalism found a way to slide into the gaming world. Before there were online stores like Steam or the App Store, programmers would sell floppy disks containing the code for their games, which understandable; you put in lots of hours into a project you’re really passionate about, you wouldn’t just give it out for free. The problem is that once one person starts to make money, everyone starts trying to make money from it. As a result, the games that were developed were no longer driven by hackers’ desire to create exciting projects, but by businesses focused on maximizing profits. They weren't looking for genius hackers anymore, but any connections or market advantages that could make them more money. And unfortunately, a lot of games are like that now where companies are making less exciting games and are just focused on making money. I won’t name any names, but certain companies love to create “new” games by repurposing old games, adding a couple extra features, and selling it as a revolutionary sequel for full price. Not to mention remakes of old games where the only thing changed are enhanced graphics and one or two extra easter eggs. You can see that companies care more about cutting corners or appealing to their audience than creating compelling and engaging games. Nostalgia and hype often take precedence over creativity, and new titles are frequently sold at prices that outweigh their entertainment value.
                        <br><br>&nbsp;Computers and the field of hacking have come a long way since their introduction: from simple mathematical calculations, to making games, to the internet, and now to development of Artificial Intelligence. They were the 20th and 21st century equivalent of the gold rush, where a sign of promise led to companies trying to capitalize on the new opportunities that arose. All modern infrastructure is heavily dependent on them and as a result, technology has become more monopolistic as only a handful of computer companies control the flow of information. To put it simply, there’s no way for the Hacker Ethic to truly and fully survive in the modern world. Technology has become too centralized for the hacker ethic to survive fully. With governments controlling what people can see online and big tech companies capitalizing on users, there’s just no room for the hacker ethic to thrive. Additionally, many people who are in tech jobs nowadays are doing it for the big bucks rather than a passion. While there are those who pursue a job in software because they love computers, the vast majority do it for the paycheck. 
                        <br><br>&nbsp;That being said, the hacker ethic isn’t completely dead. We may have to disregard some parts of the hacker ethic in order to make a living, but we can still practice the hacker ethic online. There are many open-source programmers who try to decentralize access to content or improve existing project repositories. Anyone with a passion or curiosity for these topics pick up a computer and start coding away. Because that’s what it means to be a hacker.

                        Reading 02: Hackers Hackers Everywhere
                    </h1>

                    <p class="details">
                        &nbsp;The True and Hardware Hackers are two sides of the same coin; they are believers in the hacker ethic focusing  on the decentralized access of technology for the good of society rather than political or economic gain. Where they differ is their methods of execution. The True Hackers strive to create and refine software while Hardware Hackers strive to design and share hardware with others. The reading this week explores how Hardware Hackers try to spread awareness and teach others about the uses of new technologies like computers at the time.
                        <br><br>&nbsp;One of the main things I see nowadays that the reading highlights is the idea of an aura of elitism. This is the idea that technology can only be used by those who are specially trained, but the fact is that anyone can learn how to use a computer. All the information is out there on the internet, all you have to do is look for it and learn. Bob Albrecht taught a class at the Control Data Corporation in which he taught students how to use a computer. This class eventually became a bazaar (get it?) of knowledge, with students sharing knowledge and teaching each other. A couple of years later, Albrecht would open his own nonprofit, the Portola Institute, focused on educating kids about the world of computers. Albrecht’s drive perfectly encapsulates what the Hacker Ethic strives for. He showed that learning about computers isn’t restricted to an age range or background. Anyone is able to learn how to use technology, it just comes down to whether you are willing to take the first steps. 
                        <br><br>&nbsp;Now, one of the main concerns that arose as technology became more commercialized is that the spirit of the hacker ethic was being replaced with pure utility. As computers became more prevalent, computers were viewed less of an art and merely as a tool to accomplish commonplace tasks. While I do believe that the hacker ethic is a good thing to live by, I don’t think that the commercialization of technology is necessarily a bad thing. I’m not expecting everyone in the world to become a hacker (for one it would be kind of boring if everyone was just hooked onto their screens). Hackers are hackers because they are passionate about working with computers. If you force everyone to live by the hacker ethic, you’re essentially taking away the passion that makes hackers hackers. Computers were initially made to help with advanced calculations and nowadays it’s a necessary utility for everyday life. While people shouldn’t have to be hackers, they should still have at least fundamental knowledge of the powerful applications of computers.
                        <br><br>&nbsp;Of course, with the rapid growth of technology, there are warranted questions about the morality of technology.  I side more with Lee Felsenstein’s argument that technology is a force for good. While I agree that technology can absolutely be used to oppress people, I don’t think that we should label technology as inherently bad. Over the years, we’ve seen how people in power have used technology to change society at other people’s expenses. Governments have used technology to spy on citizens, build destructive weapons, and divide people with propaganda and misinformation. Despite those oppressive uses of technology, I don’t think those outweigh the good technology has had in our lives. Many of the systems that we rely on are built on technology. Without technology, we wouldn’t be able to stay connected with family, make breakthroughs in medicine to save lives, or have access to free information online. I think that the power of the Hacker Ethic lies in the Hands-on Imperative. Knowledge is power; having access to knowledge and knowing what computers are capable of is essential in the modern age to properly benefit society.

                        Reading 01: Hacker? I Barely Know Her!
                    </h1>

                    <p class="details">
                        &nbsp;To Steven Levy, a hacker means a lot more than the stereotypical break into a system hacker. Instead, a hacker is someone who is able to take whatever resources they have and create something innovative and clever. In addition, these “True Hackers” adhere to the “hacker ethic,” which emphasizes decentralized free access to information to create powerful and meaningful tools through the use of computers. Levy provides several examples of people who exhibit these hacker characteristics. For example, Peter Sampson wanted to enhance the experience of playing Spacewar. Previously Spacewar had generated random pixels to represent the stars in the sky; instead, Sampson researched the constellations and generated a starry background based on the information that he could find. Sampson took the pre-existing game and took it to the next level by applying his knowledge he acquired to the game to enhance the gameplay experience. Another example was Stew-art Nelson. Nelson was another student at MIT who was intrigued by the potential of the telephone. He firmly believed in the hacker initiative, believing that innovation could flourish if people pushed boundaries and explored systems more deeply. Nelson’s approach to innovation reflects the hands-on imperative, the idea that hackers must learn from getting their hands dirty with these systems.
                        <br><br>&nbsp;Levy’s version of hacking contrasts with how pop-culture and society portrays hackers. Whenever I think of hacking, my first thoughts go to cybersecurity. Back in high school. I was part of the cybersecurity club, and whenever we discussed the topic of hackers, we’d talk about cyber attacks like remote access, backdoors, and malware. After taking technical ethics a couple years ago, the topic of hacking expanded to the idea of ethical hacking as well, the idea of trying to attack a system to create stronger protection against potential attacks. In both cases, the term hacker was always associated with online security. Pop-culture also reinforced this interpretation of hackers, as we see in movies like The Matrix, Tron, and many others (I don’t watch a lot of movies, so I can only name those two off the top of my head (and I haven’t even watched them)). 
                        <br><br>&nbsp;After reading the passage, I have another interpretation of the word hacker. From its dictionary definition, the word hacking is attributed with tearing or breaking something apart. This is sort of the origin of the pop-culture hacker, as these hackers are breaking into and potentially damaging systems. I think that the core idea of breaking something can still apply to the idea of a “True Hacker.” To me, “True Hackers” are people who are bold and creative enough to break the norms or meta. Hackers take what they have and they create something better and new with that. Think about everyday apps we use like Amazon, Google, or Facebook. When they were being created, the idea of using the internet in those ways was unheard of, but the hacker minds behind them used what they had (resources, knowledge, technology) to create something revolutionary. This spirit of hacking isn’t confined to software alone; this hacker mentality of challenging conventions and questioning what’s possible can be applied to everyday problems. After all, there’s a reason why we call them life hacks. For example, you can use binder clips as makeshift deskside cable holders or wrap banana stems in foil to improve their shelf life. I also have a personal life hack for getting more bang for your buck at Chipotle. If you ever want a burrito, buy a burrito bowl and ask for an extra tortilla on the side. It might be a little bit more expensive, but you end up getting more filling then if you had just ordered a burrito. Sure the burrito example is a bit out of left field, but the same guiding principle is there: applying your knowledge, experiences, and resources in order to discover optimal solutions and patterns.
                        <br><br>&nbsp;So whether it’s coding up the next big software platform or just trying to get more out of your Chipotle bowl, we should strive to live like “True Hackers” and try to create bold and innovative solutions to improve our own and others’ lives.
