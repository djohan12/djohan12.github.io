                        Reading 01: Hacker? I Barely Know Her!
                    </h1>

                    <p class="details">
                        &nbsp;To Steven Levy, a hacker means a lot more than the stereotypical break into a system hacker. Instead, a hacker is someone who is able to take whatever resources they have and create something innovative and clever. In addition, these “True Hackers” adhere to the “hacker ethic,” which emphasizes decentralized free access to information to create powerful and meaningful tools through the use of computers. Levy provides several examples of people who exhibit these hacker characteristics. For example, Peter Sampson wanted to enhance the experience of playing Spacewar. Previously Spacewar had generated random pixels to represent the stars in the sky; instead, Sampson researched the constellations and generated a starry background based on the information that he could find. Sampson took the pre-existing game and took it to the next level by applying his knowledge he acquired to the game to enhance the gameplay experience. Another example was Stew-art Nelson. Nelson was another student at MIT who was intrigued by the potential of the telephone. He firmly believed in the hacker initiative, believing that innovation could flourish if people pushed boundaries and explored systems more deeply. Nelson’s approach to innovation reflects the hands-on imperative, the idea that hackers must learn from getting their hands dirty with these systems.
                        <br><br>&nbsp;Levy’s version of hacking contrasts with how pop-culture and society portrays hackers. Whenever I think of hacking, my first thoughts go to cybersecurity. Back in high school. I was part of the cybersecurity club, and whenever we discussed the topic of hackers, we’d talk about cyber attacks like remote access, backdoors, and malware. After taking technical ethics a couple years ago, the topic of hacking expanded to the idea of ethical hacking as well, the idea of trying to attack a system to create stronger protection against potential attacks. In both cases, the term hacker was always associated with online security. Pop-culture also reinforced this interpretation of hackers, as we see in movies like The Matrix, Tron, and many others (I don’t watch a lot of movies, so I can only name those two off the top of my head (and I haven’t even watched them)). 
                        <br><br>&nbsp;After reading the passage, I have another interpretation of the word hacker. From its dictionary definition, the word hacking is attributed with tearing or breaking something apart. This is sort of the origin of the pop-culture hacker, as these hackers are breaking into and potentially damaging systems. I think that the core idea of breaking something can still apply to the idea of a “True Hacker.” To me, “True Hackers” are people who are bold and creative enough to break the norms or meta. Hackers take what they have and they create something better and new with that. Think about everyday apps we use like Amazon, Google, or Facebook. When they were being created, the idea of using the internet in those ways was unheard of, but the hacker minds behind them used what they had (resources, knowledge, technology) to create something revolutionary. This spirit of hacking isn’t confined to software alone; this hacker mentality of challenging conventions and questioning what’s possible can be applied to everyday problems. After all, there’s a reason why we call them life hacks. For example, you can use binder clips as makeshift deskside cable holders or wrap banana stems in foil to improve their shelf life. I also have a personal life hack for getting more bang for your buck at Chipotle. If you ever want a burrito, buy a burrito bowl and ask for an extra tortilla on the side. It might be a little bit more expensive, but you end up getting more filling then if you had just ordered a burrito. Sure the burrito example is a bit out of left field, but the same guiding principle is there: applying your knowledge, experiences, and resources in order to discover optimal solutions and patterns.
                        <br><br>&nbsp;So whether it’s coding up the next big software platform or just trying to get more out of your Chipotle bowl, we should strive to live like “True Hackers” and try to create bold and innovative solutions to improve our own and others’ lives.

                        Reading 02: Hackers Hackers Everywhere
                    </h1>

                    <p class="details">
                        &nbsp;The True and Hardware Hackers are two sides of the same coin; they are believers in the hacker ethic focusing  on the decentralized access of technology for the good of society rather than political or economic gain. Where they differ is their methods of execution. The True Hackers strive to create and refine software while Hardware Hackers strive to design and share hardware with others. The reading this week explores how Hardware Hackers try to spread awareness and teach others about the uses of new technologies like computers at the time.
                        <br><br>&nbsp;One of the main things I see nowadays that the reading highlights is the idea of an aura of elitism. This is the idea that technology can only be used by those who are specially trained, but the fact is that anyone can learn how to use a computer. All the information is out there on the internet, all you have to do is look for it and learn. Bob Albrecht taught a class at the Control Data Corporation in which he taught students how to use a computer. This class eventually became a bazaar (get it?) of knowledge, with students sharing knowledge and teaching each other. A couple of years later, Albrecht would open his own nonprofit, the Portola Institute, focused on educating kids about the world of computers. Albrecht’s drive perfectly encapsulates what the Hacker Ethic strives for. He showed that learning about computers isn’t restricted to an age range or background. Anyone is able to learn how to use technology, it just comes down to whether you are willing to take the first steps. 
                        <br><br>&nbsp;Now, one of the main concerns that arose as technology became more commercialized is that the spirit of the hacker ethic was being replaced with pure utility. As computers became more prevalent, computers were viewed less of an art and merely as a tool to accomplish commonplace tasks. While I do believe that the hacker ethic is a good thing to live by, I don’t think that the commercialization of technology is necessarily a bad thing. I’m not expecting everyone in the world to become a hacker (for one it would be kind of boring if everyone was just hooked onto their screens). Hackers are hackers because they are passionate about working with computers. If you force everyone to live by the hacker ethic, you’re essentially taking away the passion that makes hackers hackers. Computers were initially made to help with advanced calculations and nowadays it’s a necessary utility for everyday life. While people shouldn’t have to be hackers, they should still have at least fundamental knowledge of the powerful applications of computers.
                        <br><br>&nbsp;Of course, with the rapid growth of technology, there are warranted questions about the morality of technology.  I side more with Lee Felsenstein’s argument that technology is a force for good. While I agree that technology can absolutely be used to oppress people, I don’t think that we should label technology as inherently bad. Over the years, we’ve seen how people in power have used technology to change society at other people’s expenses. Governments have used technology to spy on citizens, build destructive weapons, and divide people with propaganda and misinformation. Despite those oppressive uses of technology, I don’t think those outweigh the good technology has had in our lives. Many of the systems that we rely on are built on technology. Without technology, we wouldn’t be able to stay connected with family, make breakthroughs in medicine to save lives, or have access to free information online. I think that the power of the Hacker Ethic lies in the Hands-on Imperative. Knowledge is power; having access to knowledge and knowing what computers are capable of is essential in the modern age to properly benefit society.
